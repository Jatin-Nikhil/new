# webhotel
First application written in Django, a python framework. It is a web application designed for a hotel.  
The sites are responsive.  
There is a working login-registration system and a booking system dependant on the user authorization status. The user can also see his bookings. I used some javascript plugins like SlickNav and DateTimePicker. Images are taken from: hanzatower.pl and hotel-atrium.pl. Just for the purpose of simulating real hotel website.  
It is currently hosted at: http://soumati.pythonanywhere.com/
